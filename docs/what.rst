What is Bookshelf?
==================

Bookshelf provides a way to catalogue or keep track of molecular dynamics trajectories with a minimal amount of meta data that should be enough to make the trajectory reproducible as far as possible.  The intention was to make this process as non-onerous as possible for depositors (usually members of an academic simulation group) and simply within a group itself; ie not really as a means for public access to simulation data but a kind of notebook for Group Leaders.

The web-interface aspect is there just to give an overview of what is in the database - deposition is intended to be performed via the command line interface (CLI).  However, it would be quite easy to adapt the php code that is provided to include an interface to allow deposition via the web as well.
