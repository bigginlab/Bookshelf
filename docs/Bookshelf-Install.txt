Bookshelf Installation for Unix:

To use bookshelf, python and mysql should be installed on the system and you need MySQLdb plugin for python to connect to the database. Run install.sh as root to set up the program. The  install script does the following :

1.It creates MySQL database named bookshelf with two tables to store the metadata and set up a bookshelf user in mysql with password  granting all privileges on the database.

2.It sets the hostname, username, password and the database name in     		
./bookshelf/bin/exe/mysql_connect.py .

3.For browsing the database, it will create another mysql user with only read permissions to browse the meta data in the bookshelf database. It sets the variable in 
./bookshelf/bs/exe/dbConnect.py

4.It will prompt  to set up the path  to temporary storage location and the final storage disk. The files are stored temporarily in temporary storage area before they are copied by the daemon to the permanent location.

5.It creates a bookshelf  administrator with username and password. The bookshelf administrator have the write permissions  to the bookshelf  storage disk.The daemon process is run by the administrator to copy the trajectories from the temporary folder ( ./bookshelf/temp)  to the permanent location  (./bookshelf/data/trajfiles).

This completes the Installation of the main service.

Web Browsing Interface
You can provide a means to browse the interface by copying the web folder into a location on your webserver. (The install script   sets the variables in the mysql_connect.php)

Login Control
To monitor the login, the script creates a login database in mysql and a mysql login user. It also sets the variables in login_connect.php

Mac Installation: The installation of Bookshelf on Mac is as same as mentioned above.

Notes.
1.  Logs for the daemon run are written in daemon.log  and errors in error.log
2. An entry in the bookshelf database can be deleted by the  bookshelf administrator:
     $python ./bookshelf/bin/exe/bookshelf.erase.py -e <trajid>
3. To add a simulation package run the following command:
	$ add.program.py –p <program name> <.ext1> <.ext2> <.ext3> <.ext4>
where program name is the name of software package one wants to add;  ext1, ext2, etc are the extensions for the mandatory files that need to be submitted for the deposition.
